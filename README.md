# prettyjson: JSON formatting utility

This is an extremely simple JSON pretty-printing utility I whipped up to help
parse API responses via `curl`. I've mostly thrown it up here so I can install
it elsewhere easily, but maybe you'll find it useful as well.

## Installation

1. Install [Go](http://golang.org)
2. Create a [workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces)
3. `go get github.com/justinian/prettyjson`
4. The tool is installed at `$GOPATH/bin/prettyjson`
